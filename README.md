# Ruleset of tagging

Below list of rules may go against scene setups but the goal is to have a clearer tagset than the origins.

* Nordic: We include nordic audio and nordic subtitles.
* Nordicsubs: Only nordic subtitles are available.
* Multi: A shitload of languages are included, both for audio and subtitles.
